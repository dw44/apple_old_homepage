Part of the Odin Project's web development curriculum. Link to original project specification: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients

The page only copies the layout of the original but none of the functionality. All links lead to the page itself, and there are no JS scripts or backend. Some details intentionally ommitted.
